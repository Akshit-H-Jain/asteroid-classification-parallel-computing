# asteroid-classification-parallel-computing

Efficiently classify and predict asteroid properties from a large dataset using machine learning enhanced with parallel computing. This approach accelerates analysis while improving the accuracy of asteroid trajectory and characteristic predictions.

## Dataset

Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle:

[NASA JPL Asteroid Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset/data)

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a model for asteroid classification using parallel computing methods for pre-processing and model training. We aim to compare the speed-up performance achieved through parallel processing on various hardware configurations, enhancing the predictive accuracy and efficiency of asteroid classification models.
